     Abstract

    <p id="Par1">
     This study aims to identify colorectal cancer (CRC)-related proteomic profiles and develop a prediction model for CRC onset by integrating proteomic profiles with genetic and non-genetic factors (QCancer-15) to improve the risk stratification and estimate of personalized initial screening age. Here, using a two-stage strategy, we prioritize 15 protein biomarkers as predictors to construct a protein risk score (ProS). The risk prediction model integrating proteomic profiles with polygenic risk score (PRS) and QCancer-15 risk score (QCancer-S) shows improved performance (C-statistic: 0.79 vs. 0.71,

     = 4.94E–03 in training cohort; 0.75 vs 0.69,

     = 5.49E–04 in validation cohort) and net benefit than QCancer-S alone. The combined model markedly stratifies the risk of CRC onset. Participants with high ProS, PRS, or combined risk score are proposed to start screening at age 46, 41, or before 40 years old. In this work, the integration of blood proteomics with PRS and QCancer-15 demonstrates improved performance for risk stratification and clinical implication for the derivation of risk-adapted starting ages of CRC screening, which may contribute to the decision-making process for CRC screening.

     Non-invasive approaches for risk stratification and screening remain crucial for colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, the authors develop a model for CRC risk stratification by integrating plasma proteomics data with polygenic risk score and QCancer-15 risk score, which could guide recommendations for earlier screening of high-risk populations.

    Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy and the second cause of cancer death globally
    <sup>

    </sup>
    . Currently, the most effective way to reduce the burden of CRC remains early detection by population screening. Although the modalities of screening vary internationally, screening programs are mostly based on age and family history and not considered other risk determinants. However, accumulating evidence indicates that substantial variation of CRC risk among populations is not only attributed to age and family history, especially the incidence of early-onset CRC has gradually increased in recent years
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">
      2
     </xref>
    </sup>
    . Furthermore, given that colonoscopy (the gold standard) is invasive, time consuming, and expensive, further identification of non-invasive early screening and diagnostic biomarkers and development of the risk-based, personalized screening recommendations for improving screening effectiveness is urgently required.

    Blood proteins, appearing in circulation due to active secretion or cellular leakage, present a holistic readout of human health states and diseases

    and act as a major reservoir of biomarkers and therapeutic targets, holding easier accessibility and the most intrinsic predictive potential for diseases

    . Several studies have shown the close bond between circulating proteins and CRC risk

    and suggested that protein biomarkers have the potential to discriminate CRC cases from controls
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">

     –

    </sup>
    . However, these proteins-based predictive studies were based on case-control design, with small sample size. Population-based longitudinal study, in theory, is more appropriate to estimate early molecular signatures associated with disease onset for risk stratification. Moreover, genetic and well-established non-genetic factors (e.g., QCancer-[15 yr, colorectal])
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">

    also play an important role in CRC incidence and contribute to risk stratification of CRC

    . Harnessing circulating proteins, as well as genetic and non-genetic factors simultaneously can be expected to develop predictive tools with better clinical utility in CRC.

    In this work, we use a two-stage strategy based on case-control and independent prospective population cohort to identify and validate the CRC-related proteomic profiles (Fig.

    ). Then, QCancer-15 risk score and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are constructed and combined with key protein biomarkers to develop a prediction model for CRC onset. Last, we evaluate the predictive performance of the combined model and potential clinical utility in the aspect of net benefit, risk stratification, and personalized initial screening age for CRC.

     Of the 88 proteins identified by two-stage strategy, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-Cox regression was applied to optimize the selection of protein signatures associated with CRC risk. Consequently, 15 protein biomarkers (IGFBP4, WFDC2, TFF1, LTBP2, COL18A1, CCN3, SELL, PON3, ADGRG2, IGF2R, PZP, CDON, TNXB, APLP1, CR2) were finally selected to construct the protein risk score (ProS) for CRC risk (Fig.

When considering CRC risk separately for colon and rectum, the C-statistic of the combined model reached 0.79 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.85) for colon cancer and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.91) for rectal cancer. The combined model tended to perform better than QCancer-S alone regardless of whether the participants had previously been screened for bowel cancer or a family history of CRC. The C-statistic of the combined model reached 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.85) for participants without screening, 0.79 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.95) for participants who had previously been screened before they were recruited into the UKBB one year and earlier, and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.98) for participants with family history. Similar results were also observed in the validation cohort. For participants without a family history of CRC and no screening, the combined model still showed improved discrimination than QCancer-S alone in both training (C-statistic, 0.82 vs. 0.71,

For instance, when the risk probability was 1%, the net benefit for combined model was 0.65% in whole population (0.62% in training cohort, 0.71% validation cohort), meaning that compared with assuming that none of participants were intervened, 65 (62 in training cohort, 71 in validation cohort) net detect CRCs without an increase of false-positives and unnecessary colonoscopies per 10,000 participants. The net benefit for the combined model was 0.24% (0.24% in training cohort, 0.21% in validation cohort) greater than assuming that all participants were intervened and 0.10% (0.11% in training cohort, 0.06% in validation cohort) greater than the QCancer-S model (Supplementary Data

Furthermore, there were 24 (24 in training cohort, 21 in validation cohort) fewer false-positives for the combined model whereas only 14 (13 in training cohort, 15 in validation cohort) fewer false-positives for the QCancer-S model per 100 individuals. In stratification by sex or tumor site, the combined model still performed better than QCancer-S alone (Supplementary Fig.

    Using a two-stage strategy, we identified CRC-related circulating proteomic profiles and prioritized 15 protein biomarkers for risk stratification. The prediction model integrating proteomic profiles with genetic (i.e., PRS) and non-genetic factors (i.e., QCancer-15) performed better across all metrics than QCancer-15 alone. In addition, the combined model markedly stratified the risk of CRC onset and derived risk-adapted starting ages for CRC screening. Compared with the medium risk group, participants with high ProS, PRS, or ComS reached the equivalent CRC risk of 4.7, 17.9, or even 27.5 years earlier, while 4.4, 8.9 or 15.2 years later in the low ProS, PRS, or ComS group. When referencing the general population aged 50 years old, participants with high ProS, PRS, or ComS were proposed to start screening at age 46, 41, or before 40 years old, while the corresponding low-score groups were proposed to start screening at age 57 or after 60 years. Similar results were observed in participants without a family history of CRC and no screening.

    The two-stage study design identified and prioritized 15 circulating protein biomarkers associated with CRC incidence. Most of them have reported evidence to be associated with either CRC risk, prognosis, or response to the therapy in either protein level (i.e., TFF1, LTBP2, PZP)

    . LTBP2 (Latent-transforming growth factor beta-binding protein 2) is a member of the fibrillin/LTBP superfamily. Both mRNA and protein levels of LTBP2 in CRC tissues were reported to be remarkably higher than those in adjacent normal tissues, and high LTBP2 protein level was linked to poor overall survival in CRC patients, suggesting that LTBP2 might act as an oncogene in CRC development and an important biomarker for predicting CRC prognosis

Similarly, Wang et al. reported that serum PZP protein level was related to the response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT), and rectal cancer patients with a higher level of PZP tended to pathological complete response, with potential predictive value for rectal cancer with nCRT

Even though there were differences in protein coverage (candidate strategy vs. proteome), study designs, and study population, the protein (IGFBP3) included in their model and the protein (IGFBP4) included in our model both belong to the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein family, which indicated the generalizability in some degree. By integrating proteomic profiles with PRS and QCancer-15, we constructed a combined model with a C-statistic of 0.79 for prediction of the risk of CRC incidence in a prospective cohort, which showed better performance than the QCancer-15 or PRS alone models in both training and validation cohorts. In addition, the results from the decision curve analysis and Kaplan–Meier curves showed an increased net benefit of the combined model to the QCancer-15 alone model and suggested the potential clinical utility in risk stratification for CRC.

    The risk-adapted starting age of screening has important clinical and public health significance for individualized prevention of cancer. A previous study based on the family history of CRC estimated that participants with different family histories reached a 10-year cumulative risk of CRC equal to the risk at age 50 years old in the average-risk population 3–29 years earlier

    . Another study focusing on sex and PRS using the approach of RAP estimated that individuals in the lowest or highest PRS decile reached an equivalent risk of CRC onset at 8–10 years later or earlier than individuals in middle PRS deciles, and males in the highest PRS decile reached comparable risk at 16 years earlier than females in middle PRS deciles

    . Consistently, our study employed both RAP and absolute risk (i.e., 10-year cumulative risk) methods and obtained similar estimates for risk-adapted starting ages of CRC screening. We found that participants in high PRS group reached the equivalent CRC risk 17.9 years earlier than participants in the medium PRS group, whereas participants in low PRS group were 8.9 years later than medium group. Similarly, when using the average-risk adults at 50 years old which is the screening age recommended by the current guidelines as ref.

    , the age of participants with high- or low-PRS reached 10-year cumulative CRC risk equal to comparable risk was 41 or &gt;60 years old. Additionally, we extended these approaches to proteomics and estimated the risk-adapted starting age of CRC screening for participants with ProS in high or low group to be 46 or 57 years old. When integrating QCancer-15, PRS, and ProS, the ages reached equivalent risk across different risk groups showed greater separation. Participants in high ComS group reached the equivalent CRC risk 27.5 years earlier than participants in medium group, while 15.2 years later for participants in low ComS group than medium group. The risk-adapted starting age of CRC screening for participants in high- or low-risk group was estimated to be before 40 or after 60 years old. Similar results were observed in participants without a family history of CRC and no screening who usually have a relatively lower risk and are easily overlooked. Overall, these findings supported strong evidence for promoting proteomics in clinical practice, which could contribute to improving personalized risk assessment and screening of CRC and the development of precision medicine for CRC.

    This study has some strengths. First, a two-stage design based on high-throughput proteomic technologies was used to identify the CRC-related proteomic profiles, which ensured that the proteins with stable associations with CRC across different populations and proteomic platforms were used for modeling, improving the generalizability of these findings. Second, the community-based prospective cohort with a large sample size, good representation, and long-term follow-up allowed us to build a population-based prediction model for CRC onset. Third, integrating the circulating proteomic profiles with genetic and well-established non-genetic factors provided a holistic readout of human health states, which contributed to the more precise and comprehensive risk stratification for CRC to help focus limited resources on individuals with high risk. Fourth, RAP and 10-year cumulative risk provided similar results for the recommendation of risk-adapted starting ages of CRC screening, which implied the stability and reliability of the current findings. Additionally, the parameters needed for the model building can be obtained from self-reported and a single non-invasive biospecimen (i.e., blood), which ensured the feasibility and acceptance. Nevertheless, several limitations of this study require careful consideration. First, although the CRC-related proteomic biomarkers were identified by a two-stage design based on both Chinese and UKBB populations, the prediction model was established in the UKBB (including European and non-European ancestry participants) with only internal verification. Further research based on independent external populations was needed to assess the generalizability before applying the current findings in routine care. Second, the RAP and 10-year cumulative risk could not be used in assessing risk-adapted starting age of CRC screening across different QCancer-S groups due to the age information itself included and predominated in QCancer-S. Further research to evaluate the contribution of well-established non-genetic factors (excluding age) in risk-adapted starting age of CRC screening may be interesting. Additionally, although most of the estimates of RAPs were similar between the training cohort and validation cohort, the RAP estimates for several risk score groups were not significant in the validation cohort, which may be partly attributed to the small number of cases. Lastly, not only the initial screening age but also screening intervals are included in screening strategies. The screening intervals for risk-adapted CRC screening need to be investigated by future studies.
   </p>
   <p id="Par19">
    In conclusion, the integration of blood proteomics with PRS and QCancer-15 demonstrated improved performance for risk stratification and clinical implication for the derivation of risk-adapted starting ages of CRC screening. This may contribute to the decision-making process for CRC screening, with the potential to reduce the screening burden of people with lower risk, while improving screening detection rates. Future research to evaluate the acceptance, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of the combined model and risk-adapted screening age is needed.

Briefly, using a two-stage strategy, we first explored CRC-related protein biomarkers by proteome-wide differential expression analysis based on a case-control design and validated them in an independent prospective population cohort. Then, the ProS, QCancer-S, and PRSs were constructed and integrated to develop a prediction model for the risk of CRC onset based on the prospective population cohort.
