     Abstract
    </title>
    <p id="Par1">
     The treatment of diabetic wounds faces enormous challenges due to complex wound environments, such as infected biofilms, excessive inflammation, and impaired angiogenesis. The critical role of the microenvironment in the chronic diabetic wounds has not been addressed for therapeutic development. Herein, we develop a microneedle (MN) bandage functionalized with dopamine-coated hybrid nanoparticles containing selenium and chlorin e6 (SeC@PA), which is capable of the dual-directional regulation of reactive species (RS) generation, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), in response to the wound microenvironment. The SeC@PA MN bandage can disrupt barriers in wound coverings for efficient SeC@PA delivery. SeC@PA not only depletes endogenous glutathione (GSH) to enhance the anti-biofilm effect of RS, but also degrades GSH in biofilms through cascade reactions to generate more lethal RS for biofilm eradication. SeC@PA acts as an RS scavenger in wound beds with low GSH levels, exerting an anti-inflammatory effect. SeC@PA also promotes the M2-phenotype polarization of macrophages, accelerating wound healing. This self-enhanced, catabolic and dynamic therapy, activated by the wound microenvironment, provides an approach for treating chronic wounds.

   <p id="Par3">
    Chronic wounds are a common complication of diabetes that affect ~25% of patients with diabetes
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">

    . The annual costs for treating chronic wounds and scars exceed $5 billion, imposing a huge financial burden on patients and the healthcare system
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">
      3
     </xref>
    </sup>
    . The healing process of diabetic wounds is hindered by biofilms infections, persistent inflammation, and impaired angiogenesis
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">

    </sup>
    . Currently, several therapeutic strategies are available for managing diabetic wounds, including aggressive debridement, surgical angiogenesis, antibacterial therapy, and bioengineered alternative tissue products
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">
      7

     ,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">

     </xref>
    </sup>
    . However, most of these strategies are restricted by the complex pathogenesis of chronic wounds and are not completely effective for the treatment of diabetic wounds. Therefore, there is a need for the development of versatile therapeutic strategies encompassing antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and pro-angiogenesis effects to address the treatment of diabetic wounds.
   </p>
   <p id="Par4">
    Chronic wounds, including diabetic wounds, are frequently infected with biofilms
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">
      9
     </xref>
     ,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">
      10
     </xref>
    </sup>
    . Bacteria are protected by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of the biofilms that form a strong barrier against antibiotics and immune cells
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">
      11
     </xref>
     ,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">
      12
     </xref>
    </sup>
    . Because of being packed in EPS, these biofilms exhibit specific microenvironments in wound beds, such as low pH and high levels of glutathione (GSH)
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">
      13
     </xref>
     ,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">
      14
     </xref>
    </sup>
    . Therefore, exploiting the special characters of the biofilms microenvironment is a promising strategy to prevent biofilms infections. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a minimally invasive procedure that does not involve issues of drug resistance, has received significant attention as an antibacterial approach
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">
      15
     </xref>
     ,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">

     –
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">
      17
     </xref>
    </sup>
    . There are challenges associated with the use of PDT to effectively treat biofilms infections, as the ROS generated by photosensitizers (PS) can be depleted by the high levels of GSH in biofilms
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">
      18
     </xref>
    </sup>
    . To address these issues, most studies focus on the depletion of endogenous GSH by mediators such as nitric oxide (NO)
    <sup>

    </sup>
    However, the strategy of exploiting high GSH level in biofilms to enhance PDT has been barely reported. Previous studies have shown that selenite (SeO

    and •OH

     –
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">
      22
     </xref>
    </sup>
    . In contrast, ROS production, which is lethal to cells, is not triggered in normal cells with low GSH levels, thereby protecting cells from apoptosis
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">
      22
     </xref>
    </sup>
    . Based on this inspiration, we propose a strategy to effectively amplify PDT by depleting endogenous GSH, and generate active molecules that are more lethal to biofilms by utilizing endogenous GSH, thus facilitating the eradication of biofilms.
   </p>
   <p id="Par5">
    Another point of concern is that ROS is a double-edged sword
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">
      23
     </xref>
    </sup>
    . Wound beds covered by biofilms are excessively inflammatory, and oxidative stress in wounds can be aggravated by the ROS produced during PDT to destroy biofilms, leading to impaired wound healing
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">
      24
     </xref>
    </sup>
    . Therefore, the prompt elimination of ROS during PDT is crucial to prevent further exacerbation of wound inflammation, as well as enhance the antioxidative capacity of the wound beds for providing an anti-inflammatory effect from the outside to the inside. Moreover, an important factor affecting the efficacy of therapeutics is their point of delivery. The importance of the role of the delivery point in promoting wound healing has been well studied
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">
      9
     </xref>
    </sup>
    . Chronic wounds are typically covered with inflammatory exudates and biofilms
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">
      25
     </xref>
    </sup>
    , which constitute a physicochemical barrier hindering the penetration of topical therapeutic agents into the underlying live tissues. Thus, when drugs are applied topically, their local bioavailability is reduced, as expected. A delivery system that can disrupt the physiochemical barriers created by inflammatory exudates and biofilms, shorten the travel distance of therapeutics by directly delivering them to wound tissue can improve drug efficacy.
   </p>
   <p id="Par6">
    In this work, we develop a multifunctional microneedle (MN) bandage for diabetic wound treatment. As shown in Fig.
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">
     1a
    </xref>
    , dopamine-coated hybrid nanoparticles (SeC@PA) containing selenium (Se) and chlorin e6 (Ce6) are firstly prepared, and then modified with L-arginine (LA) on the surface. The MN bandage is loaded with SeC@PA to obtain SeC@PA MN. When the SeC@PA MN is applied to diabetic wounds, the physiochemical barriers are broken, and SeC@PA are effectively delivered to the biofilms and wound live tissue (Fig.
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">
     1b
    </xref>
    ). We hypothesize that after delivery into the biofilm-infected sites, SeC@PA can not only deplete GSH and generate reactive nitrogen species (RNS) to enhance the anti-biofilms effect of PDT, but also utilize the high levels of GSH in biofilms to generate hydroxyl radical (•OH) through a series of catalytic cascade reactions (Fig.
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">
     1c
    </xref>
    ). Conversely, after delivery into the highly inflammatory wound tissue, SeC@PA exhibits potent antioxidant effects by rapidly scavenging RS and enhancing glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity (Fig.
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">
     1d
    </xref>
    ). Moreover, SeC@PA can effectively promote macrophage polarization toward the M2-phenotype, thereby facilitating wound healing (Fig.
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">
     1e
    </xref>
    ). The bidirectional regulation of RS by SeC@PA through different GSH levels is demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. The therapeutic efficacy of SeC@PA MN is studied in a mouse model of diabetic wounds. Our study highlights a self-augmented, catabolic, and dynamic therapy to effectively manage chronic diabetic wounds.

     In this study, Se was first prepared following an established method

      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">

     </sup>
     . Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images indicated that Se particles were uniform with an average diameter of 38.42 ± 0.85 nm (Supplementary Fig.
     <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">
      1a, d
     </xref>
     ). Dopamine (DA) was used to coat the surface of Se and encapsulate the photosensitizer (Ce6) to obtain SeC@P. LA was adsorbed on the surface of SeC@P by electrostatic interaction to form SeC@PA. The characterization results are shown in Fig.
     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">

     . Product morphologies were observed using TEM. SeC@P exhibited a spheroid morphology (Supplementary Fig.
     <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">
      1e
     </xref>
     ) with good dispersity similar to that of Se@PA (Fig.
     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">
      2a
     </xref>
     ). The hydrodynamic diameters of SeC@P and SeC@PA were 90.00 ± 1.82 nm and 108.47 ± 1.01 nm (Supplementary Fig.
     <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">
      1b, c

     ), respectively. The zeta potentials indicated that SeC@P had a negative charge and SeC@PA had a positive charge (Supplementary Fig.
     <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">
      1f
     </xref>
     ), suggesting that the positively charged LA was successfully introduced on the surface. The successful assembly of SeC@PA was also validated using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) (Supplementary Fig.
     <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">

     <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">
      3
     </xref>
     ). The results revealed that SeC@PA was composed of not only the basic elements C, O, and N, but also Se. The loading efficiency of Se, Ce6, and LA in SeC@PA was calculated as 23.23 ± 4.11%, 8.40 ± 4.38%, and 12.60 ± 3.79%, respectively (Supplementary Table

     It was expected that the delivery of SeC@PA to biofilms would result in the rapid degradation of the PDA layer, leading to the release of Ce6 and Se. This release would trigger a cascade reaction, generating an RS storm to eradicate the biofilms. Therefore, we studied the release behavior of Ce6 and Se from SeC@PA under different pH conditions. The release of Ce6 from SeC@PA was accelerated in a weakly acidic environment (pH = 5.5) (Supplementary Fig.

     To verify the ability of SeC@PA to bidirectionally regulate RS at different GSH levels in vitro, the fluorescent probe 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) was used to evaluate RS generation. As shown in Fig.

     , abundant RS was produced by C@PA under irradiation (C@PA(+)) in PBS solution (pH = 5.5) without GSH. At the same time, RS generated by SeC@PA(+) was significantly reduced, proving that Se could eliminate RS in the absence of GSH. Nevertheless, when C@PA(+) was co-incubated with 8 mM GSH (high GSH levels in biofilms), RS levels were dramatically decreased due to the depletion by GSH. Surprisingly, unlike C@PA(+), SeC@PA(+) exhibited the highest RS levels in 8 mM GSH solution, which was attributed to Se producing RS with more oxidative activity by decomposing GSH. In vitro experiment results demonstrated that SeC@PA(+) could more quickly deplete GSH during irradiation compared with C@PA(+) (Fig.
     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">
      2i
     </xref>
     ). Subsequently, we explored the impact of varying concentrations of GSH on the RS generated by SeC@PA (+) and C@PA (+). As exhibited in Fig.
     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">
      2e
     </xref>
     , the intensity of RS in the C@PA(+) group was observed to decrease with increasing GSH concentration, which was attributed to the scavenging effect of GSH on the RS. In contrast, SeC@PA(+) played a role in scavenging RS at low GSH concentrations (≤0.4 mM), while enhancing RS intensity at high concentrations (≥ 0.8 mM). A turning point was clearly observed, which indicated that SeC@PA successfully achieved bidirectional regulation of RS. When a low-level GSH (2 μm), for simulating the GSH concentration in healthy tissue, was introduced into the system, similar results were obtained as compared with that without GSH, where SeC@PA(+) mainly acted as a RS scavenger (Supplementary Fig.
     <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">

     ) degradation were used to determine •OH production. The results showed that SeC@PA(+) could produce active •OH only when GSH levels were high. These results suggested that at high GSH levels, SeC@PA(+) participated in GSH degradation and led to higher RS levels, whereas RS-scavenging ability was exhibited at low GSH levels, thereby achieving bidirectional RS regulation.

     ) demonstrated the remarkable capability of the MN bandage to penetrate barriers and directly deliver SeR@PA to the desired target region. In contrast, SeR@PA NPs alone exhibited limited penetration, primarily confined to the surface of the barrier, thereby impeding its ability to reach the deeper target regions. Collectively, these results suggested that the MN bandages could overcome the obstacles of local drug delivery in chronic wounds, delivering the drug directly to the site of action for therapeutic effect.

To balance the antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity, we selected a concentration of SeC@PA containing 20 μg/mL of Se, 7.2 μg/mL of Ce6, and 10.8 μg/mL of LA for follow-up studies.

     , respectively. The results showed that the biofilm in the C@P(+) group remained relatively intact and only exhibited weak anti-biofilm effects. In contrast, the anti-biofilm effect was obviously enhanced in the C@PA(+) group with compromised biofilm integrity, which should be due to the reason that the addition of RNS resulted in a stronger anti-biofilm effect. Among all the groups, SeC@PA(+) group showed the strongest anti-biofilm activity, which benefited from the generation of RNS and •OH. These results were consistent with the RS intensity results in the biofilm. Therefore, three types of RS generated by SeC@PA were involved in the anti-biofilm mechanism in this study, and this strategy is termed as “RS storm”. The anti-biofilm contributions of the three RS were quantified through crystal violet staining experiments (represented by the biomass of the biofilm). As shown in Supplementary Fig.

As opposed to the groups without laser irradiation, the C@PA(+) and SeC@PA(+) groups could significantly reduce GSH levels in the biofilms by producing NO after laser irradiation, and GSH levels in SeC@PA(+) group was lower than that in the C@PA(+) group. These results were consistent with the findings obtained in in vitro experiments. Interestingly, the ability of SeC@PA(+) to eliminate GSH was significantly stronger than that of C@PA(+), indicating that Se was involved in the degradation of GSH after irradiation. Similar results were observed for PA biofilms (Supplementary Fig.

     RS produced by anti-biofilms further exacerbates the inflammatory response in wound beds. Therefore, the ideal therapeutic effect is that in the case of low levels of GSH, SeC@PA can not only scavenge the RS generated by the anti-biofilm but also eliminate RS generated by wound tissue. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were employed to validate the antioxidant properties of SeC@PA as HUVECs are extremely sensitive to RS. As illustrated in Fig.

To evaluate whether SeC@PA could promote the level and activity of GPX through biosynthesis and enhance the antioxidant capacity of wounds, we studied the level and activity of GPX4 after treatment. We labeled GPX4 in HUVECs with red fluorescence and observed them using laser confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig.

     , the red fluorescence in the cytoplasm and nucleus was significantly enhanced in Se@PA and SeC@PA(+) treated groups compared to the control and C@PA(+) groups, suggesting an increase in GPX4 levels. We further analyzed GPX4 levels using western blotting, and the relative expression of GPX4 in the Se@PA and SeC@PA(+) groups was 1.64- and 1.79-fold higher than that in the control group, respectively (Fig.

     ). The representative cytokine detection results of M2-like macrophages showed that IL-4 and IL-10 levels increased significantly and that IL-1 and TNF-α levels decreased considerably after SeC@PA(+) treatment (Fig.
     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">

     ). These results indicated that SeC@PA(+) could effectively activate macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype.
    </p>
    <p id="Par18">
     To further explore the mechanism by which SeC@PA(+) promotes the polarization of macrophage to the M2-phenotype, we used quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) and western blotting to elucidate the signaling pathway of SeC@PA(+). Previous studies have shown that Se levels can affect IL-4-promoted M2-macrophage polarization
     <sup>
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">
       42
      </xref>
     </sup>
     . Therefore, we hypothesized that SeC@PA(+) could regulate the expression of certain signals in the IL-4 pathway and promote macrophages toward M2-type polarization. IL-4-mediated M2-macrophage polarization has been well established through a Janus kinase type 1 (JAK1) signal transducer and activator of the transcription 6 (STAT6) pathway
     <sup>
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">
       43
      </xref>

     . We first investigated the expression of
     <italic>

     <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">
      23a

     ). Notably, the mannose receptor (MR)-mediated polarization of macrophages toward the M2 type also increases

     <sup>
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">

     </sup>
     . Therefore, we used western blotting to further confirm the mechanism of SeC@PA(+) in promoting macrophage polarization. The findings (Fig.
     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">
      5b–e

     and Supplementary Fig.
     <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">

     ) showed that SeC@PA(+) significantly upregulated the levels of phosphorylated JAK (p-JAK1) and phosphorylated STAT6 (p-STAT6) but had no significant effect on phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) levels, indicating that SeC@PA(+) activation occurred via the JAK-STAT6 pathway (Supplementary Fig.

     ). Unsurprisingly, cells in the C@PA(+) group were neither migrated nor angiogenesis was detected because RS production impairs the function of HUVECs. Conversely, after incubation with SeC@PA(+), cell migration and angiogenesis were restored due to the scavenging effect of RS. However, SeC@PA(+) treatment did not result in a significant increase in the migration and angiogenesis of HUVECs compared with those in the control group. Considering that the polarization of macrophages into the M2 type promotes wound healing, we further explored the influence of adding RAW264.7 cells on HUVECs behavior. Surprisingly, after adding RAW264.7 cells, SeC@PA(+) treatment significantly promoted the migration and tube-forming ability of HUVECs compared with those in the other groups. To determine whether this phenomenon was attributed to SeC@PA(+) stimulating RAW264.7 cells to secrete certain factors regulating the behavior of HUVECs, we determined the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in cells after SeC@PA(+) treatment. As shown in Fig.
     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">
      5j–m
     </xref>
     , the levels of VEGF in RAW264.7 cells were significantly increased compared with those in the control group. Conversely, the levels of VEGF in HUVECs treated with SeC@PA (+) group exhibited no obvious difference from those in the control group, indicating that SeC@PA(+) promoted RAW264.7 cells to secrete VEGF, thereby enhancing cell migration and tube-formation abilities of HUVECs. Overall, SeC@PA(+) could promote wound healing by regulating the polarization of macrophages to the M2 type, thereby secreting VEGF, which promotes migration and tube formation in HUVECs.

     These results indicated that RS produced by PDT treatment alone (C@PA MN(+)) has the risk of delaying diabetic chronic wound healing. It is necessary to remove the RS produced by PDT immediately to avoid secondary injury to the wound tissues. SeC@PA MN (+) could effectively remove the RS produced by PDT in wound tissues, alleviate oxidative stress, and promote wound healing.

     To further explore whether the location of SeC@PA in the wound is responsible for the differences in therapeutic effects between SeC@PA MN(+) group and SeC@PA NPs(+) group, we investigated the distribution of SeC@PA after administration. Firstly, biofilms were generated by infecting chronic diabetic wounds with
     <italic>

     </italic>
     expressing GFP for easy observation. Secondly, SeR@PA MN and SeR@PA NPs were prepared by replacing Ce6 with rhodamine for better observation of the distribution of SeC@PA in the wound coverings. After two days of biofilm growth, SeR@PA MN and SeR@PA NPs were applied to the wound, respectively. As shown in Fig.
     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">
      7e, f
     </xref>
     , SeR@PA MN effectively punctured the wound coverings and delivered SeR@PA to the underside of the wound coverings, and the penetration depth of SeR@PA was increased with the duration of administration. However, SeR@PA from SeR@PA NPs was mostly captured by the biofilms on the surface of the wound coverings, which could reach neither the biofilms deep in the wound coverings nor the area below it. To investigate the penetration efficiency of SeR@PA from SeR@PA MN and SeR@PA NPs into the wound coverings, the wound coverings were placed into transwells, which were then inserted into a 24-well plate to determine the amount of SeR@PA permeated into the well plates (Fig.
     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">
      7j
     </xref>
     ). The SeR@PA MN group showed higher wound covering penetration efficiency compared to that of SeR@PA NPs (Fig.
     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">
      7k
     </xref>
     ). At the same time, we performed bacterial coated plate counting on the wounds after 4 days of treatments with SeC@PA MN(+) and SeC@PA NPs(+), showing that the antibacterial effect of SeC@PA MN(+) was much stronger than that of SeC@PA NPs (+) group (Supplementary Fig.

     These results demonstrated the advantages exhibited by MNs in the field of treating chronic wounds. Chronic diabetic wounds are often covered with inflammatory exudates and biofilms, which form a physicochemical barrier that prevents the penetration of therapeutic drugs into the action sites beneath the wound coverings. Therefore, conventional local delivery methods have limitations in the treatment of chronic wounds. On the contrary, MNs can penetrate the physicochemical barrier on the wound surface to achieve deeper and wider drug delivery, effectively eradicating the biofilm, reducing oxidative stress, and promoting angiogenesis and collagen deposition in the wound to facilitate wound healing.

     Subsequently, we investigated the effects of SeC@PA MN on biofilm-infected diabetic chronic wounds. Firstly, we determined GSH content in wound coverings (including biofilms and inflammatory exudates) and wound tissues (beneath the wound coverings) to determine whether there were differences in GSH content to achieve the bidirectional regulatory effect of SeC@PA on RS. As displayed in Supplementary Fig.
     <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">

     , the GSH content in the wound coverings was much higher than that in the wound tissue, with a content as high as 6.69 mmol/g, which was 9.3 times higher than 0.72 mmol/g in the tissue. This difference in GSH content could provide a basis for achieving different regulatory effects of SeC@PA on RS at the two sites.

In the SeC@PA MN(+)-treated wounds, the epidermis and dermis of the skin were relatively intact and highly ordered, and inflammatory cell infiltration was less. Additionally, the relative CD31 fluorescence intensity (Fig.

     It is worth noting that the healing of chronic diabetic wounds is a complex process that requires simultaneous anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory effects to promote healing. Se@PA MN can scavenge RS but cannot eradicate biofilms, exacerbating the inflammatory response in wounds. C@PA MN(+) can kill most bacteria by generating RS, which further aggravates the inflammatory response of wounds. Therefore, neither Se@PA MN nor C@PA MN(+) can effectively promote wound healing, which was consistent with the results of wound healing in our study. In addition, the detection of RS in Se@PA was limited to the early stage of wound healing (at day 4). Persistent bacterial infection aggravates the oxidative stress response in wounds and inactivates the functions of some enzymes such as GPX4, which may explain why Se@PA MN did not significantly increase GPX4 activity and levels. Therefore, SeC@PA MN(+) effectively promoted wound healing by eradicating biofilms and reducing inflammation, thereby increasing angiogenesis and collagen deposition.

     . It is well known that the infiltration of chronic wounds by M1-like macrophages results in a persistent inflammatory response that hinders wound healing. Therefore, modulation of macrophage polarization to the M2-phenotype with anti-inflammatory activity can benefit wound closure. To further illustrate the effect of SeC@PA MN(+) on macrophage polarization, the infiltration of macrophages into wounds was investigated using immunofluorescence staining. The wounds treated by SeC@PA MN(+) exhibited decreased M1-phenotype macrophage (F4/80

In addition, SeC@PA MN(+) significantly increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory factors IL-4 and IL-10 and decreased those of the pro-inflammatory factors IL-1 and TNF-α, further demonstrating that macrophages were polarized to the M2- phenotype (Fig.

   <p id="Par30">
    Infected biofilms, persistent inflammation, and impaired angiogenesis are the hallmarks of diabetic chronic wounds. There is an urgent need to develop anti-biofilm, anti-inflammatory, and pro-angiogenic multifunctional agents to promote the healing of chronic diabetic wounds. PDT has been widely studied as antibacterial therapy owing to its virtue of generating ROS. However, high GSH concentrations in biofilms limit the therapeutic effect of PDT. In addition, ROS plays a dual role in eradicating biofilms and exacerbating inflammation. PDT produces a large amount of ROS in a short time. Although these ROS are transient, they can interfere with cell function, including that of HUVECs, and delay wound healing, especially in chronic wounds with severe oxidative stress, where this damage is more severe. Resolving this issue necessitates the introduction of additional ROS scavengers, which not only complicates the system but also impedes its clinical translation. Moreover, a frequently overlooked challenge lies in selecting the appropriate site of action, particularly in the context of chronic wound treatment. Chronic wounds are often covered with inflammatory exudates, which, together with biofilms, form barriers. Topically used drugs must pass through the barrier to reach the underlying live cells while combating the exudate transport occurring in the reverse direction, and therefore, the bioavailability of topical drugs is greatly reduced.

    . In our work, MN is used to puncture the physicochemical barrier covering the wound bed, leading to the subsequent delivery of cargo to the biofilms and active tissue. Compared with the local delivery SeC@PA NPs, the SeC@PA MN bandage can deliver SeC@PA directly to the biofilms and wound tissues below the wound coverings, greatly improving the bioavailability of the drug. When SeC@PA is delivered to biofilms with high GSH levels, •OH, which is more toxic than

    (mainly produced by Ce6), is generated during irradiation through a series of cascade decomposition reactions. Simultaneously, NO, produced by LA, is employed to deplete GSH and generate RNS, forming an RS storm to eradicate the biofilm. This therapeutic effect cannot be achieved merely by depleting GSH to assist PDT. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that the bacteria in the biofilms are efficiently eliminated by SeC@PA(+), indicating the effectiveness of the self-enhancing anti-biofilm strategy at high GSH levels. When applied to wound tissues with low GSH levels, SeC@PA acts as an RS scavenger, quickly quenches the RS produced by SeC@PA after irradiation, and increases the levels and activity of GPX4, thereby reducing wound inflammation. These results suggest that SeC@PA could dynamically regulate RS without extra additives by sensing different GSH levels, simultaneously eradicating biofilms and inhibiting inflammation.

    Another obstacle in the healing process of chronic diabetic wounds is the infiltration of M1-phenotype macrophages. The anti-inflammatory effect due to the scavenging of ROS is transient. Remodeling the immune environment of the wound beds, especially polarizing macrophages to the M2-phenotype with a sustained anti-inflammatory effect, is necessary to promote healing. In this study, the SeC@PA clearly improves macrophage polarization into the M2-phenotype through the JAK-STAT6 pathways, promoting the levels of the anti-inflammatory factors IL-4 and IL-10 and reducing the levels of the pro-inflammatory factors. Macrophage polarization to the M2-phenotype promotes HUVEC migration and tube formation in vitro by secreting VEGF. The infiltration of M2-phenotype macrophages in wounds obviously increases in diabetic mice with chronic wounds, facilitating the inhibition of inflammation and promoting angiogenesis. Thus, this study represents the initial exploration of a potential therapeutic approach for chronic wounds by targeting the distinct microenvironments of biofilms and wound beds. These findings offer valuable insights into the rational design of topical treatments for the effective management of chronic wounds.

Lastly, LA (50 mg) was added to SeC@P solution under stirring at room temperature for 12 h to obtain Se-Ce6-DA-LA nanoparticles (SeC@PA). The hydrodynamic size and zeta potential of Se, SeC@P, and SeC@PA were measured using a zeta potential analyzer (Malvern Mastersizer 2000, UK). The levels of Se, Ce6, and LA in SeC@PA were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (PerkinElmer Optima8300, USA), ultraviolet spectrophotometry (Tecan/Infinite E plex, Switzerland), and the Sakaguchi reaction, respectively.
