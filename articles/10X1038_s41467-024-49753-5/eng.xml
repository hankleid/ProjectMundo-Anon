     Abstract
    </title>
    <p id="Par1">
     Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) are used globally as a key component of clean and sustainable energy infrastructure, and emerging LiB technologies have incorporated a class of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) known as bis-perfluoroalkyl sulfonimides (bis-FASIs). PFAS are recognized internationally as recalcitrant contaminants, a subset of which are known to be mobile and toxic, but little is known about environmental impacts of bis-FASIs released during LiB manufacture, use, and disposal. Here we demonstrate that environmental concentrations proximal to manufacturers, ecotoxicity, and treatability of bis-FASIs are comparable to PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic acid that are now prohibited and highly regulated worldwide, and we confirm the clean energy sector as an unrecognized and potentially growing source of international PFAS release. Results underscore that environmental impacts of clean energy infrastructure merit scrutiny to ensure that reduced CO

     emissions are not achieved at the expense of increasing global releases of persistent organic pollutants.

     A new class of PFAS (bis-perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides) used in lithium-ion batteries have been released to the environment internationally. This places lithium-ion batteries at the nexus of CO2 reduction and release of recalcitrant aquatic contaminants.

In sum, there is potential for widespread environmental releases of PFAS such as bis-FMeSI during the manufacture of electrolytes, fluoropolymers, and LiBs and also during product use, recycling, and disposal. LiBs are used worldwide, so this is an issue of global concern. The occurrence of bis-FMeSI at low ng L

    This study is a cradle-to-grave evaluation of the environmental impacts of bis-FASI use in LiBs. First, bis-FASI occurrence in the environment was evaluated in the United States (USA) and internationally near sites of PFAS manufacturing. Next, the aquatic toxicity of bis-FMeSI was assessed using

     Daphnia magna

    (

    ) and
    <italic>
     Danio rerio
    </italic>
    (zebrafish) models. Additionally, the occurrence of bis-FASI in use and disposal scenarios was established through screening of LiBs and landfill leachate samples. Lastly, the treatability of bis-FASIs was evaluated with sorbents commonly used in water treatment (granular activated carbon [GAC] and ion exchange [IX] resin) and under conditions relevant to advanced oxidation. Although this study focused on bis-FASIs, occurrence and treatability assessments also included other PFASs including perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) and sulfonates (PFSAs), perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides (FASAs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl ether carboxylates and sulfonates (PFEAs), and n:2 fluorotelomer sulfonates (n:2 FTSAs) to frame bis-FASI results within the context of more well-studied PFAS.

     of bis-FMeSI, respectively, but the exposure was conducted at 50% dilution. MN 15 did not have detectible levels of bis-FMeSI and was used as a field control representing other (e.g., co-occurring contaminant) exposures. Bis-FMeSI exposure induced significant changes in embryonic mitochondrial function. Specifically, bis-FMeSI concentration-dependent decreases in basal mitochondrial respiration, proton leak, spare capacity, and maximal mitochondrial respiration were detected in 30 hpf embryos. Similar effects were observed in previous studies for PFAS and PFOS but at much higher concentrations

    This study demonstrates an international release of LiB-associated PFAS (bis-FASIs, particularly bis-FMeSI) to soil, sediment, and surface water and that concentrations of these compounds in the parts per billion are common, near manufacturing areas. When coupled with low-level detections in three Chinese seawater samples

    </sup>
    and characteristics consistent with vPvM classification, this suggests bis-FASI release is global. Furthermore, atmospheric emission of bis-FMeSI, as suggested by the MN data, may facilitate long-range transport of this subclass of PFAS. Toxicity data demonstrated that bis-FMeSI could change behavior and fundamental energy metabolic processes of aquatic organisms at low ng L
    <sup>
     −1
    </sup>
    levels, suggesting that even relatively low-level concentrations will be of concern for aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates. In addition, the use of bis-FMeSI and other PFAS in LiB-enabled consumer products will lead to environmental contamination at end-of-life disposal (i.e., municipal solid waste landfills). Lastly, due to recalcitrance and solubility, bis-FASIs pose similar treatment challenges as those associated with other PFAS although adsorptive treatment approaches designed to remove PFOA and PFOS are expected to effectively remove bis-FASIs. Where these treatment approaches are not in place or are not engineered for bis-FASI removal, the potential for exposure may be elevated. This underscores a need for additional studies of bioaccumulation and human health impacts. In general, the challenges associated with bis-FASI occurrence, mobility, ecotoxicity, and recalcitrance are similar to those that have been realized for other PFAS; however, the potential for ongoing and increasing release of bis-FASIs resulting from exponentially growing demand for LiBs is distinct. Further, other uses of bis-FASIs (e.g., CO

    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">

    </xref>
    ) should be evaluated to determine their contribution to ongoing release. Without changes in manufacturing, use, disposal, and treatment practices, concentrations of bis-FASIs in soil, groundwater, surface water, wastewater residuals, and landfill leachate are likely to increase, along with associated human and environmental exposure. It is important to emphasize that bis-FASIs are not currently regulated anywhere in the world, so there is a lack of regulatory drivers to catalyze changes needed to mitigate these exposures.

    There is no universal definition of PFAS, but bis-FMeSI is considered to be a PFAS according to two of three commonly referenced definitions (see Supplementary Note

    . In contrast, the bis-FEtSI and bis-FBSI homologs are included along with longer homologs not studied here and other PFAS structurally similar to bis-FMeSI (e.g., trifluoro(trifluoromethoxy)methane; CASRN 1479-49-8). Failure to categorize bis-FMeSI as PFAS, therefore, seems arbitrary and without scientific rationale based on considerations such as occurrence, fate, and toxicological effects. Further, the exclusion of bis-FMeSI paves the way for continued, unregulated emissions of a global contaminant into the environment.

    , the use of GAC and IX is likely to increase rapidly. Immediate consideration of bis-FMeSI as a removal target would capitalize on the ongoing design and installation of infrastructure at water treatment facilities in response to increasing regulation and provide an opportunity to include proper engineering considerations during system design for regions where bis-FASIs are of concern. Bis-FASIs in concentrated wastes (e.g. landfill leachates and spent IX/GAC) will require destructive treatment for complete mineralization, and research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of such methods.

    Bis-FASIs are associated with both LiB electrolytes and fluoropolymers (e.g., PVDF). There has been a recent debate within the practitioner and research communities regarding the designation of fluoropolymers as polymers of low concern (PLCs)

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">

    . Concerns with this designation include leaching of low molecular weight PFAS from fluoropolymers. The presence of bis-FMeSI in PVDF in this study supports those concerns. Results of this study provide a clear indication that the impacts of manufacturing, use, and end-of-life management associated with infrastructure components such as LiBs require additional consideration along with other issues such as resource recovery. This includes environmental impacts associated with other fluorinated, but non-PFAS LiB electrolytes

     It was necessary to install ice cores at all MN locations in Pool 2 of the Mississippi River prior to the collection of surface water samples. An 8” diameter ice auger was used to core through ice at all locations. Because of subfreezing temperatures, the auger could not be cleaned between locations, but as described below, samples were collected well below the water surface. Additionally, the most contaminated sample locations were completed last. All project surface water samples were collected into new high-density polyethylene (HDPE) containers that were triple rinsed with LC–MS grade MeOH and air dried, and samplers were wearing clean, nitrile gloves that were changed between each sampling location. Surface water and deep water sediment samples (i.e., that could not be reached by trowel) were collected using an extendable dipper rod attached to an HDPE sample cup. All surface water samples collected in January 2022 were collected ~3 ft below the water surface to minimize the potential for cross-contamination due to the ice auger. In all sampling events, the sample cup was triple-rinsed with water from that sample location prior to sample collection. The snow sample was scooped directly into a clean HDPE container. Soil samples and shallow sediment samples were collected with a stainless steel trowel that was triple-rinsed with MeOH and DI water between sampling locations. Tap water and groundwater (i.e., a private well) samples were collected from the taps of the homes they served directly into the sampling container. Samples were stored on ice and shipped to laboratories at Texas Tech and Duke Universities. Sample amounts remaining after preparation for analysis were frozen as archives. Each sampling trip also included the collection of duplicates and field blanks, as discussed in the results.

     - (trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP, 2.5 µM; Sigma-Aldrich) is an uncoupler that collapses the proton gradient and disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential. The resultant uninhibited flow of electrons through the ETC and oxygen consumption by complex IV pushes mitochondria to their maximum respiration rate. From this, maximum respiration and spare capacity (the difference between maximal and basal respiration), the ability to respond to an increased energy demand or stress, was calculated. Sodium azide (6.25 mM; Sigma-Aldrich) inhibits oxidative phosphorylation via inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase, rapidly depleting intracellular ATP and effectively shutting down mitochondrial respiration. The remaining non-mitochondrial respiration is attributed to enzymes and other factors within the cells that continue to consume oxygen.

     A series of statistical analyses were conducted on zebrafish data.

Basal mitochondrial respiration was defined as basal respiration minus non-mitochondrial respiration. ATP production was calculated by subtracting the three lowest OCR values following the addition of Oligomycin A from basal respiration. Proton leak was calculated by first averaging the three lowest OCR values following the addition of Oligomycin A and then subtracting non-mitochondrial respiration. To find maximal mitochondrial respiration, the three highest OCR values following the addition of FCCP were averaged, and then the non-mitochondrial respiration was subtracted from this average. This average was also used to calculate spare capacity by subtracting basal respiration from it. For larval locomotion, the total distance traveled (mm) for each light and dark period, not including habituation, was averaged.

     . The rapid small-scale column test (RSSCT) column was assembled using polypropylene (PP) tubing with a 0.318 cm inside diameter and stainless steel valves and fittings from Swagelok (Solon, OH). A ~3 cm glass wool base was packed at the bottom of the column to provide support and stabilize the GAC/IX bed position during the run. Crushed GAC (0.042 g) and IX (0.011 g) were weighed in a beaker and then soaked in deionized water, followed by degassing in a vacuum desiccator for 24 h prior to packing. Degassed GAC/IX were loaded into the column using a glass Pasteur pipette. The packed GAC/IX column was equilibrated for 24 h by pumping deionized water through the column at the design flow rate using a Shimadzu LC pump (Model LC-20AT, Shimadzu Scientific, Columbia, MD). The influent solution was then switched to surface water or groundwater, which was dosed with 21 PFAS (Supplementary Figs.

     . Influent samples were collected directly from the container at the beginning and end of the run. During the RSSCT run, effluent samples were collected periodically for PFAS analysis together with the influent samples. To capture the breakthrough of PFAS breaking through both early (e.g., PFMOAA and PFBA) and late (e.g., PFDA and PFOS), around 4 mL of samples were taken approximately every 250-bed volumes (BVs) for the first 1000 BVs treated, then every 500 BVs until 2000 BVs treated, then every 1000 BVs until 15,000 BVs treated, then every 5000 BVs until 50,000 BVs (GAC column run was completed) treated, and then every 20,000 BVs (IX only) until the run was complete.

     Alkaline heat-activated oxidation
    </title>
    <p id="Par52">
     Three bis-FASI homologs, bis-FMeSI, bis-FEtSI, and bis-FBSI, were subjected to an alkaline, heat-activated persulfate oxidation to screen fate during advanced oxidative treatment and during application of the total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay. The TOP assay is a commonly applied PFAS analytical tool that evaluates the total molar concentration of oxidizable PFAS by measuring PFCA concentrations pre- and post-oxidation. The oxidation step converts perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) precursors to terminal PFCAs such that the change in PFCA concentration can be used to infer a total molar, oxidizable precursor concentration. The TOP assay facilitates the evaluation of concentrations of “unknown” PFAS in samples since many PFAS do not have the analytical standards needed to analyze them directly using targeted analysis. In this study, deionized water was spiked with 1000 ng L

     . Spiked samples were amended with 100 mM potassium persulfate and 220 mM sodium hydroxide and placed in a water bath (Fisher Scientific, FSSWB15) for 12 h at 85 °C. Following the oxidation, samples were cooled down to room temperature, and pH was adjusted to 5–9 by HCl. Aqueous samples were then prepared for targeted analysis as described above.
