     Abstract
    </title>
    <p id="Par1">
     The rice theory of culture argues that the high labor demands and interdependent irrigation networks of paddy rice farming makes cultures more collectivistic than wheat-farming cultures. Despite prior evidence, proving causality is difficult because people are not randomly assigned to farm rice. In this study, we take advantage of a unique time when the Chinese government quasi-randomly assigned people to farm rice or wheat in two state farms that are otherwise nearly identical. The rice farmers show less individualism, more loyalty/nepotism toward a friend over a stranger, and more relational thought style. These results rule out confounds in tests of the rice theory, such as temperature, latitude, and historical events. The differences suggest rice-wheat cultural differences can form in a single generation.

     According to the rice theory, the demands of rice farming might make cultures more collectivistic. Here the authors provide evidence in support of this theory by showing that Chinese farmers who were quasi-randomly assigned to farm rice score higher on measures related to collectivism than those assigned to farm wheat.

    The rice theory of culture argues that traditional paddy rice farming caused rice-farming cultures to become more collectivistic than wheat-farming cultures

    . Paddy rice required irrigation networks and labor demands double those of wheat, which tied farmers together in tight, interdependent relationships. Rice cultures from Japan to Sierra Leone formed cooperative labor exchanges to cope with the crushing labor demands of rice

    , causality is a difficult question for this theory. Does rice farming actually cause these cultural differences?
   </p>
   <p id="Par4">
    When we compare cultures, third variables make it difficult to know what is a cause and what is just a correlation. Experiments solve this problem, but in the case of rice and wheat, we cannot randomly assign people to farm rice or wheat for years on end. Nor is it easy to simulate the complicated process of rice farming in a laboratory. It is essentially impossible to bring participants to a lab and simulate the full scope of social relationships, monitoring, and reciprocity that stretch over seasons, years, and generations in rice villages.
   </p>
   <p id="Par5">
    This study takes advantage of a unique time in history when the Chinese Communist Party essentially randomly assigned people to farm rice or wheat. After World War II, the government created state farms around the country to open up new farmland, put former soldiers to work, and re-educate urban youth
    <sup>

    </sup>
    . In northern Ningxia Province, the government created two farms just 56 kilometers from each other—one rice, one wheat (Fig.

    ).

       Although the two state farms are only 56 kilometers from each other, a small difference in topography allows the rice farm (Lianhu) to farm paddy rice. In contrast, much of the land in the wheat farm (Qukou) is 50–100 m above the nearby Yellow River, making large-scale irrigation uneconomical. The soil on the wheat farm is also sandier, which makes it difficult to retain water in rice fields. Image from Google Earth.

    ). Both sit near the Yellow River, which brings water that can irrigate paddy rice. But a minor difference in the topography allowed one to farm rice and the other wheat. Most of the wheat farm is 50 to 100 meters above the river, which prevents economical irrigation. This created a rare natural experiment where Chinese citizens were quasi-randomly assigned to farm rice or wheat.

However, the wheat farm has sandier soil and slightly higher elevation than the nearby Yellow River, which makes irrigation impractical.

These two farms provide a situation close to a naturalistic randomized experiment, which helps rule out potential confounds. If the rice theory is true, we should see cultural differences between the rice and wheat farms that mirror larger comparisons between China’s rice-farming south and wheat-farming north.

      chose

     to move to one farm over the other. For example, if people knew (or even just had a vague sense) that rice requires working more closely with other people, then the people who already liked working with other people might actively choose to go to the rice farm rather than the wheat farm. Another example of selection would be if the government intentionally selected people with prior experience farming rice for the rice farm. These scenarios would invalidate the natural experiment.

     and our interviews with farm administrators suggest that government assignments between these two rice and wheat farms were effectively random. The government was not concerned with modern ideas of occupational interest questionnaires or personal choice. Farm records reveal that most farmers in Lianhu and Qukou were (a) regular citizens assigned by the government, (b) military veterans assigned by the government to the area, or (c) educated youth assigned to Ningxia during the Cultural Revolution

     There is a telling example from 1960, when the government started the Youth Assisting Ningxia (支宁青年) movement. This movement sent youngsters to Ningxia to develop new farmland. The rice-farming province of Zhejiang sent many youth to Ningxia for this movement. If leaders were trying to assign people to the right farm based on their skills, this was a golden opportunity to send people from rice areas to the rice farm. Yet records show they assigned nearly identical numbers of Youth Assisting Ningxia to the rice farm and the wheat farm

     . The heritages of the farmers we tested are consistent with the idea that there was no selection based on people’s regional background. Among the 234 farmers we tested, only one was born in a majority rice province. The vast majority of farmers (&gt; 99%) and their parents (98%) were from majority-wheat provinces on both farms.

     Another type of threat is non-random selection of the locations. This could happen if the government chose to put the farms on top of villages that were already farming rice or wheat. If so, the farms could simply be carrying on the cultures of the areas.
    </p>
    <p id="Par15">
     However, historical records show this was not the case. One of the goals of the government’s push to create state farms was to open up new land to farming. Before the rice farm was created, the area was an “uninhabited” wetland with 72 lakes

    </p>
    <p id="Par16">
     The land on the wheat farm was also mostly un-farmed before the government founded the state farm. Much of the area was poorly suited to farming because it had desert soil (sierozem), which is dry and devoid of nutrients (&lt; 1% organic matter). Farming only became widespread after government investment brought infrastructure and fertilizer into the area

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">
       12
      </xref>

     . The lack of farming history on this land is important for the natural experiment because the two areas were relative blank slates for farming, rather than simply carrying on the farming practices of the area.

     Finally, another potential threat to the experiment is if the two farms had systematic differences in top-down policies or economic systems. China’s biggest policy change of the last 50 years started in 1978, when China started moving from the system of collective farming profits to letting individual families keep their own profits (包产到户). If one farm rolled out this system earlier than the other, this could have differential effects on the farms separate from rice and wheat.
    </p>
    <p id="Par18">
     However, the two farms belonged to the same land reclamation group (农垦集团). This shared bureaucracy meant the two farms had the same profit structures and incentives. The shared bureaucracy also meant they tended to roll out policies at the same time. For example, historical records show the two farms rolled out the shift to individual profits within months of each other

     This quasi-random assignment offers the chance to test for rice-wheat cultural differences in a place where systematic genetic differences are unlikely.

        Farmers quasi-randomly assigned to farm rice showed three hallmarks of collectivistic cultures compared to a nearby wheat farm. Rice farmers self-inflated less while drawing sociograms (top), were more loyal/nepotistic to friends (middle), and thought more holistically (bottom). Samples were

     Controlling for demographic differences
    </title>
    <p id="Par27">
     We used regressions to control for demographic differences between the rice and wheat farm samples in gender, age, income, religion, and maternal educational attainment. There were some significant demographic differences on the cultural tasks. Older farmers thought more holistically than younger farmers,

     Differences persist even among farmers not farming rice this year
    </title>
    <p id="Par28">
     The rice farm presents a unique opportunity to test whether the rice-wheat differences require direct, recent experience farming rice. In 2000, the rice farm started facing shortages of irrigation water, so it started a rotation program so that about one-third of farmers would farm dryland crops every year. About one-third (38.4%) of the participants on the rice farm did not farm rice in the year we collected data.
    </p>
    <p id="Par29">
     Importantly, the farm rotates farmers evenly year after year. That means this is a top-down assignment that applies evenly to all farmers. The farmers are not self-selected into the program.
    </p>
    <p id="Par30">
     This allows us to compare farmers who had direct experience farming rice in the year we collected data versus those who were farming dryland crops like wheat for the year. If direct experience is required to maintain these cultural differences, we should find that individual farmers’ rice experience in the year of the testing predicts cultural differences. For the farmers temporarily rotated away from rice, the experience farming wheat and other dryland crops should make them more individualistic.
    </p>
    <p id="Par31">
     The other possibility is that direct, recent experience is not required for rice-wheat differences. Instead, rice-wheat differences may be the result of accumulated experience—and shared through broader community norms and practices. If that is the case, then direct experience in any particular year should have little or no effect on rice-wheat cultural differences. We tested this by adding individual farmers’ percentage of land farmed with rice in the most recent year of farming (Table
     <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab4">
      4
     </xref>
     ). The results clearly refuted the idea that recent individual experience farming rice is necessary for rice-wheat differences. Individual rice-farming percentages did not predict any of the cultural differences. Meanwhile, farm-level rice-wheat differences from Table
     <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">
      3
     </xref>
     remained robust even after adding individual rice farming in Table
     <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab4">
      4
     </xref>
     . In sum, rice-wheat differences persisted, even among farmers who did not farm rice in the year we tested them.

        The state rice farm rotates a third of farmers every year to plant dryland crops to preserve limited irrigation water. This table tests whether farmers’ recent experience farming rice is more important (Individual Rice %) than the overall rice or wheat system of the farms (Rice Farm). Individual Rice % is the percentage of land that each farmer planted with rice in the most recent farming season. Farm samples are matched using propensity score matching. Female, Hui, and Rice Farm are dummy variables where 0 = no, 1 = yes. Degrees of freedom = 188, except for self-inflation (friends) = 182 and holistic thought = 180.

   <p id="Par32">
    Farmers on the state rice farm showed more hallmarks of collectivistic culture than farmers on the nearby state wheat farm. Rice farmers were more loyal/nepotistic toward friends, thought more holistically, and showed less implicit individualism than the nearby wheat farmers.
   </p>
   <p id="Par33">
    Because the Chinese government unintentionally created a quasi-random assignment experiment, these two farms provide a much cleaner test of causality than prior research. The fact that these two farms still showed cultural differences effectively rules out major potential confounds like temperature, latitude, and the many historical events that differed between northern and southern China.
   </p>
   <p id="Par34">
    The natural experiment value of these two farms can also provide insights into cultural differences besides collectivism. For example, one year later, we returned to the farms for a separate study on social comparison and happiness
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">

     </xref>
    </sup>
    . In that study, we tested whether social comparison is more common on the rice farm than the wheat farmers. The rice farmers reported more social comparison, which mirrored differences between China’s larger rice and wheat areas. That increased social comparison could explain why collectivistic cultures (and China’s rice regions
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">

    ) tend to be less happy than individualistic cultures, even at the same level of wealth.
   </p>
   <p id="Par35">
    Rice-wheat differences persisted even among a subset of farmers on the rice farm who did not farm rice in the year we tested them. This suggests that there is an accumulated cultural pattern that does not require direct, recent experience. This fits with the fact that studies have found rice-wheat differences among people who have never worked as farmers, such as university students

     Limitations
    </title>
    <p id="Par36">
     One limitation of this study is that there could be demographic differences, such as age and educational attainment between the two farms. Another related limitation is that we could not randomly sample farmers because of the difficulty of reaching participants in these remote farms. To make up for this, we took three steps:
    </p>
    <p id="Par37">
     We (1) measured a range of demographic variables for the farmers to measure variables that might otherwise be hidden confounds, (2) statistically controlled for demographics in generalized linear models, and (3) used propensity score matching to create sub-samples from the rice and wheat farms that minimized potential demographic confounds. These steps help lessen the possibility that demographic differences are causing spurious differences between the farms.
    </p>
    <p id="Par38">
     A second limitation is that the farmers had some difficulty completing the tasks that were originally designed for college students. Some farmers had difficulty bringing to mind friends on the sociogram task, which led us to create a family version of the task. We are making the family sociogram task available to other researchers to use (available on the OSF page).
    </p>
    <p id="Par39">
     Third, the low reliability of farmers’ responses to the relational mobility questionnaire suggests that they had trouble answering these questions. The relational mobility questionnaire uses complex and negatively worded questions, which may be hard for people to process. Thus, we were forced to discard this questionnaire. These difficulties speak to the importance of creating simple, concrete tasks like the triad categorization task or the new family sociogram task that are useful across diverse populations.

     From two farms to a larger theory of culture
    </title>
    <p id="Par40">
     This study presents a tightly controlled, narrow comparison of rice and wheat. Yet the findings imply that there is a more general theory of the causes of cultural differences. The larger idea is that interdependence in subsistence style (or perhaps in work more generally) makes cultures more collectivistic. For example, cultures that used irrigation tend to be more collectivistic today

     Rice and wheat farming are important because they are two subsistence styles that represent the ancestors of billions of people around the world. Yet there are other important subsistence styles that are worth incorporating into this theory, such as herding and fishing

     Thousands of generations compared to one generation on a rice farm
    </title>
    <p id="Par42">
     It may be surprising that there were rice-wheat differences at all because these two farms have only existed for the length of a single person’s lifetime (roughly 70 years). The finding that rice-wheat differences can appear that fast suggests that direct experience on a farm is enough to influence people’s social style and way of thinking. In the scope of history, a single generation is an incredibly short period of time compared to the thousands of years rice has developed along with cultural institutions in southern China.
    </p>
    <p id="Par43">
     There is an important difference between these two farms and the rest of China. These two farms provide laboratories that expose people to farm work and the social relationships of the rice and wheat farms, but not the larger social institutions of the rice regions of southern China. For example, rice areas of southern China have more family clans than northern China
     <sup>
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">
       22
      </xref>
     </sup>
     . There is evidence that regions with more clans are more collectivistic
     <sup>
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">
       23
      </xref>
     </sup>
     . Over many generations, rice villages developed different social institutions, which probably magnified the underlying differences. Yet the state rice farm is an island of rice farming in northern China.
    </p>
    <p id="Par44">
     Its short existence and isolation from the social institutions of the south probably explain why differences between the rice and wheat farms were smaller than differences between southern and northern China as a whole. For example, holistic thought differences between the two state farms were 28% the size of differences between northern and southern China in a previous study
     <sup>
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">

     </sup>
     . This suggests that rice culture can form in the length of a single human’s lifetime, but we should not overlook the effects that accumulate as cultures build reinforcing institutions such as family clans, local dialects, and regional governments.

     Quasi-random assignment makes genetic explanations less likely
    </title>
    <p id="Par45">
     The quasi-random assignment makes it unlikely that there are systematic genetic differences between the rice and wheat farms. This helps put context around prior evidence of cultural differences in genetics tied to social traits across East and West

     . The idea is that intensive farming—particularly rice farming—requires more interdependence than the wheat farming and herding of the West. Yet this explanation is hard to test because there are many differences between East and West in religion, language, government, and history. That makes it impossible to isolate just one causal factor.
    </p>
    <p id="Par47">
     The data from these two farms offer a potential insight into this larger East-West theory while practically eliminating these potential confounds across East and West.

     We aimed to test 100 farmers from each farm. Our stopping rule was to stop at 200, while still completing any sessions that were in the queue at the time of 200. The stopping rule was independent of any results. We waited until data collection was complete before analyzing the data. This resulted in a total sample of 234 farmers (Table

    </p>
    <p id="Par51">
     A majority of the farmers in our sample (73.5%) grew up on the farms. Thus, most participants were lifelong farmers and descendants of people assigned to the farms. That leaves about a quarter of farmers (26.5%) who were assigned to the farms after childhood. Nearly all of the participants (96.2%) were farming in the year of the study. The rest were working on administrative tasks on the farms.

    <p id="Par52">
     Farmers completed the tasks on paper individually. A research assistant was there to help with any questions. In the analyses, we controlled for potential demographic differences in age, gender identity, family income, and religion.

        First, we chose measures that previous research has linked to rice-wheat differences and larger East-West differences.

      . Then they chose one of two other objects to pair with it, such as a dog or carrot. One pairing belongs to the same abstract category (rabbits and dogs are mammals), and one pairing shares a functional relationship (rabbits eat carrots). We calculated the percentage of relational pairings as a measure of holistic thought. Previous studies have found that people in collectivistic cultures like China, Thailand, and India choose more relational pairings than individualistic cultures like the US, UK, and Netherlands

      For the sake of simplicity, we use the term “wheat” to stand in for major dryland staples. We do this because the differences between rice and wheat are similar to the difference between rice and crops like millet, barley, corn, and potatoes

      Propensity score matching

     <p id="Par68">
      We used propensity score matching to reduce possible confounds from demographic differences in the sampling between the two farms. This helps address the shortcoming that our sampling in these hard-to-reach areas was not a random probability sampling. In the MatchIt package in R, we used optimal matching to create matched samples on age, gender identity, income, and maternal educational attainment.

      Propensity score matching has advantages over just controlling for variables in regressions. For one, regressions assume that control variables have linear effects, whereas matching does not
