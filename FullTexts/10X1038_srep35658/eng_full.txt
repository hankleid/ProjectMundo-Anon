Multi-Terminal Spin Valve on Channels with Spin-Momentum Locking

Abstract: It is experimentally established that charge current flowing in a channel with spin-momentum locking such as topological insulator surface states or Rashba interfaces induces a spin voltage, which can be electrically measured with a ferromagnetic contact along the current path. Using this fact in conjunction with Onsager reciprocity arguments, we make the surprising prediction that the anti-parallel resistance of a spin valve can be either larger or smaller than the parallel resistance depending on the direction of spin flow relative to the direction of spin-momentum locking. However, we argue that this remarkable signature of spin-momentum locking can only be observed in multi-terminal measurements. Two-terminal measurements in the linear response regime, will show a single anti-parallel resistance larger than the parallel resistance as commonly observed in channels without spin-orbit coupling. We support this result with detailed numerical calculations based on a semiclassical model that provides insight into the underlying physics.

Figure 1: (a  ) Four-terminal (4T) spin valve like setup on channel with spin-momentum locking (SML). Supply current I 12  running between ferromagnetic (FM) contacts 1 and 2 and voltage V 34  is measured between non-magnetic (NM) contacts 3 and 4. (b  ) R 12,34  = V 34 /I 12  as a function of an external magnetic field (B ext ). We observe two separate anti-parallel resistance such that R 12,34 (−1, +1) > R 12,34 (±1, ±1) > R 12,34 (+1, −1), depending on the direction of spin flow relative to the SML. Simulation was compared to  [Eq. (2)]for p c  = 0.8, p f  = 0.9, and ξ  ≈ 1. (c  ) R 12,12  = V 12 /I 12  as a function of B ext  show the usual result R 12,12 (+1, −1) = R 12,12 (−1, +1) > R 12,12 (±1, ±1) even in channels with SML. B ext  is swept in both direction between −25 mT to +25 mT as indicated by the arrows in the curves. Coercive fields of the FM contacts 1 and 2 are 20 and 5 mT, respectively. Red up and blue down arrows indicate magnetization direction m 1,2  = +1 and −1 respectively. Note that resistances in the plot are normalized to the offset resistance. Simulation was performed with a detailed semiclassical model (see Eq. (11)), with parameters: λ  ≈ 100 nm and total number of modes ≈100. The contacts 1–4 are spaced by 2λ.
